# Web-Dev-Project

## **Project_1**

#### **Problem Statement:**

You are required to design a **React-based chat interface** that mimics the look and feel of popular messaging platforms like Discord or Slack. The chat interface will only support a **single human user**, and there is **no backend** involved. The user will interact with a **bot** that performs text transformations on their input and responds with the result in the chat interface.

#### **Objectives:**

- Build a **simple chat interface** with React that allows users to send messages and receive responses.
- The bot will perform various transformations on the user's input text such as:
  - **Counting words** in the message.
  - **Counting vowels and consonants**.
  - **Finding the most frequent letter**.
  - **Reversing the text**.
  - **Jumbling the words**.
  - **Convert text to uppercase**: The bot replies with the entire message converted to uppercase.
  - **Convert text to lowercase**: The bot replies with the entire message converted to lowercase.
  - **Capitalize each word**: The bot capitalizes the first letter of each word in the message.
  - **Count the number of characters**: The bot counts and returns the total number of characters (including spaces).
  - **Remove all vowels**: The bot removes all vowels from the message.
  - **Remove all consonants**: The bot removes all consonants from the message.
  - **Repeat each word twice**: The bot repeats each word in the message twice.
  - **Replace spaces with underscores**: The bot replaces every space in the message with an underscore (`_`).
  - **Shuffle characters in each word**: The bot shuffles the letters in each word but keeps the word order intact.
- The user should see their message displayed in the chat window, followed by the botâ€™s response based on the transformation.
